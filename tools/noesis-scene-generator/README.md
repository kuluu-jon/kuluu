# noesis-scene-generator

Generates .noesis scene files from dumped json files
The .noesis files can be (batch) loaded by Noesis, then exported to formats such as .DAE or .FBX


To launch from Xcode or CLI, be sure to add launch arguments:

`-path -p` (generally just point this to `research-docs/FFXI_DATs` submodule path)
`-out -o` (the path where you want the .noesis files exported to)
