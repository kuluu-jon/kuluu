# noesis-scene-generator

This command line app takes FFXI Zone Metadata input from XML that is itself generated from `research-docs/FFXI-NavMesh-Builder-` 
After some metaprogramming and processing magic, the output is strongly typed `.swift` that is used directly by `kuluu-ffxi-emulator` to emulate the FFXI world.
