# Project Kuluu

Welcome to Project Kuluu, an open source cross-platform client emulator for FFXI. It is currently aiming to be compatible with the latest [LandSandBoat FFXI Server Emulator](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server).

Kuluu is a fan-community run project and aims to be a faithful remaster of the FFXI client to run on multiple modern game engines at 60+ FPS.

# System Requirements

Project Kuluu is currently in prototype stage, and will only work reliably on *macOS 12+, and iOS 15+*. The aim is for it to eventually work on lower versions of macOS, iOS, and Windows 10+, with a stretch goal of supporting Android and Linux as well.

Building from source is confirmed working for Xcode 13.2+, but may work on older versions as well.
